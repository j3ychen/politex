# Politex #

This was a quick UI concept presented to the board of the 2013 Entrepreneurship-Cup at the University of Virginia.

The overall idea was creating a stock-like system, where you gain points when you correctly vote for a politician, and you lose points if you incorrectly vote. It also serves as a forum, where those with the most points have the most post-visibility on the site.
