# Politex #

This was a quick UI concept presented to the board of the 2013 Entrepreneurship-Cup at the University of Virginia. Our team consisted of me, Jerry Chen, Vinay Dandekar, Alan Zhao, and Joseph Songer.

## Main Idea ##

The main idea was to build a stock system, where you gain points, or *shares*, when you correctly vote for a politician (i.e. the politician you voted for wins) and you lose points if you incorrectly vote (i.e. the politician you voted for loses). It also serves as a forum, where those with the most points have the most post-visibility on the site.

## Background ##

This idea is due to the rise of heated political discussions on various social media sites and forum sites. We figured that by creating a website solely focused on political discussions, and by rewarding individuals who vote correctly with the ability to have their thoughts more visibly displayed than those who incorrectly vote. By this logic, those who are clearly partisan and only vote their party won't be given the time of day.

Technology we were planning to use: MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js.
